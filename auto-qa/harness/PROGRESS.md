# Forked Replay Harness — Progress

End-to-end test harness that forks Gnosis at a past block, replays a futarchy
proposal lifecycle with synthetic users, and asserts cross-layer agreement
(chain ↔ indexer ↔ api ↔ frontend) at every block.

The harness spans both `futarchy-fi/futarchy-api` and `futarchy-fi/interface`.
This file is mirrored across both repos. Server-side infra (anvil, indexer,
api) is hosted here; UI infra (Playwright fixtures, page-object models) lives
in `interface/auto-qa/harness/`.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phase | 0 — in progress (slices 1-5 landed; remaining: harness package.json npm install, ARCHITECTURE.md sister-link verification) |
| Branch | `auto-qa` (both repos) |
| Location | `auto-qa/harness/` in both `interface` and `futarchy-api` |
| Runner | `npm run auto-qa:e2e` (separate from `npm run auto-qa:test`) |
| Owner | TBD |
| First-pass deadline | TBD |

## Effort breakdown (rough, per component)

| Component | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anvil fork + block clock + tx replay | S (1 wk) | Foundry already does this |
| Synthetic wallet stub for Playwright | M (2 wk) | Synpress mostly works; futarchy custom auth flows are the gotcha |
| Local Checkpoint indexer in CI | L (3 wk) | Schema migrations + warm-up time make this brittle |
| Cross-layer invariant DSL + assertion library | M (2 wk) | Has to be readable enough to debug failures |
| Scenario library (5-10 historical replays) | L (3 wk) | Each historical proposal needs careful state capture |
| OCR / DOM-equivalent price extraction | M (2 wk) | Brittle without good test IDs in the UI |
| Chaos injection + RPC fault library | S (1 wk) | tc/iptables wrapper |
| CI infra (compose, artifact capture, video on fail) | M (2 wk) | Probably the biggest day-2 cost |
| **Total** | **~3-4 months for one engineer** | |

## Phasing

Each phase is independently useful — we can stop at any phase boundary and
still have value.

| # | Phase | Effort | Stop-here value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Scaffold | 1-2 hrs | `harness/` dirs, deps, README, npm script skeleton, PROGRESS entries |
| 1 | Anvil fork + block clock | ~1 wk | Deterministic time control over a forked Gnosis chain |
| 2 | Chain ↔ api agreement (1 invariant) | ~1 wk | First cross-layer check working end-to-end |
| 3 | Local Checkpoint indexer in-loop | ~3 wks | Indexer reconciles with chain after each block |
| 4 | Synthetic wallet + first scripted swap | ~2 wks | Real on-chain mutation, full chain↔indexer↔api check |
| 5 | Playwright + DOM↔API assertions | ~3 wks | Frontend in the loop; UI consistency catches |
| 6 | Scenario library (replay 1 historical proposal) | ~2 wks | First "real bug shape" replayable |
| 7 | Chaos injection + nightly CI | ~2 wks | Production-shape resilience signal |

Single docker-compose starts all four services. Orchestrator owns the clock.

## Cross-layer invariants

| Layer A | vs | Layer B | Invariant |
|---|---|---|---|
| chain | vs | indexer | every Swap event present, same token amounts, same sqrtPrice |
| indexer | vs | api `/candles/graphql` | candle aggregates match raw swaps |
| api `/spot-candles` | vs | api `/candles/graphql` | rate-applied prices reconcile |
| api `/v2/.../chart` | vs | indexer raw | unified-chart shape consistent |
| frontend DOM | vs | api response | every visible price/volume/TVL matches the API call that produced it |
| playwright wallet swap | vs | chain receipt | tx mined, balance delta correct, conditional tokens minted |

## Economic invariants (always-on)

- **Conservation**: ∑(YES + NO conditional tokens) = ∑(sDAI deposited) at every block
- **Monotonicity**: TWAP window endpoints respect contract's `min(now, twapEnd)` clamp
- **Probability**: price ∈ [0, 1] for PREDICTION pools
- **No phantom mints**: `balanceOfBatch` sums match historical + synthetic deposits
- **Rate sanity**: sDAI rate from on-chain `getRate()` ≥ 1 and monotonically increasing

## Bug shapes this catches that nothing else can

- Indexer/chain divergence after a reorg or schema change
- Frontend showing stale numbers when the API is healthy (PR #64 shape from interface)
- Conservation breaks from new merge/split paths
- TWAP window off-by-one at the resolution boundary (PR #54 shape)
- BUY/SELL inversion regressions in `subgraphTradesClient.js`
- Multi-RPC fallback being silently broken
- Wallet-flow regressions in `useFutarchy`
- Cross-protocol price drift between Algebra / CoW / Sushi quoters

## Open decisions (deferred to per-phase work)

- **Foundry vs Hardhat** for the fork — leaning Foundry/anvil (faster, simpler RPC)
- **Local Checkpoint vs subgraph** — Checkpoint matches production but harder to bootstrap
- **Synpress vs custom wallet stub** for Playwright — Synpress is canonical but futarchy's custom flows may need extension
- **Scenario capture format** — JSON snapshot of (block range, tx list, expected end-state) vs full state-dump replay
- **CI execution model** — nightly cron vs manually-triggered workflow vs PR-gated

## Iteration log

### Phase 0 — Scaffold

- **slice 1** — README, harness package.json with stub scripts,
  .gitignore, root `npm run auto-qa:e2e` wired through
  `npm --prefix auto-qa/harness run phase-status`. Verified the stub
  prints the phase status from the repo root. No deps installed yet.

- **slice 2** — `docker-compose.yml` skeleton committed. All real
  services (anvil, indexer, api, interface-dev, orchestrator) are
  block-commented with the eventual launch command + healthcheck +
  volume layout pinned. A `placeholder` (hello-world) service keeps
  `docker compose config` valid for CI dry-runs. Networking pinned to
  a single `harness-net` bridge; volumes go to `.compose-volumes/`
  (gitignored).

- **slice 3** — `scripts/start-fork.mjs` placeholder. Argument parsing
  + help text + structured exit codes documented (0 ready, 1 args, 2
  binary, 3 unreachable, 4 readiness timeout). `--help` works today;
  actual `anvil` subprocess launch is queued for Phase 1.

- **slice 4** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` cross-repo handshake doc. Identical
  copy lives in `interface/auto-qa/harness/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Documents
  the 5-service topology, repo split table, boot sequence, invariant
  catalogue, sibling-clone instructions, and 5 deferred open questions.

- **slice 5** — `docs/ADR-001-foundry-vs-hardhat.md` written by
  background agent. **Decision: Foundry/anvil.** Per-tx replay
  throughput dominates our workload, anvil's `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp`
  + manual `evm_mine` covers our TWAP-window needs without Hardhat's
  `hardhat_mine` advantage, and the single Rust binary cuts CI footprint
  vs a Node + node_modules Hardhat project. Long-run memory creep
  mitigated via snapshot/revert at scenario boundaries.

**Phase 0 wrap-up — remaining:**

- slice 6 — `npm install` inside `auto-qa/harness/` (no deps yet, but
  generate the lockfile so future installs are reproducible)
- slice 7 — Verify the `ARCHITECTURE.md` sister-link by running the
  documented `git clone` snippet in a temp dir and confirming the
  layout works
- slice 8 — Add a `harness/CHECKLIST.md` enumerating the readiness
  criteria for declaring Phase 0 complete and Phase 1 ready to start

**After Phase 0 — Phase 1 entry criteria:**

- [ ] anvil binary discoverable on PATH (or via `forge install` script)
- [ ] `docker compose -f auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml up -d`
      brings up the placeholder cleanly on a fresh checkout
- [ ] Both ADRs reviewed + status changed from "Proposed" to "Accepted"
