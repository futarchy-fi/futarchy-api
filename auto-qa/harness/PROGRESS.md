# Forked Replay Harness — Progress

End-to-end test harness that forks Gnosis at a past block, replays a futarchy
proposal lifecycle with synthetic users, and asserts cross-layer agreement
(chain ↔ indexer ↔ api ↔ frontend) at every block.

The harness spans both `futarchy-fi/futarchy-api` and `futarchy-fi/interface`.
This file is mirrored across both repos. Server-side infra (anvil, indexer,
api) is hosted here; UI infra (Playwright fixtures, page-object models) lives
in `interface/auto-qa/harness/`.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phase | 1 — slices 1-4 landed. 4 smoke tests pass against a real Gnosis fork (start-fork+block-clock, setNextTimestamp, setBalance, impersonateAccount+sendTransaction). 6/6 CHECKLIST items ticked (compose item with caveat — daemon-down skip). Ready for Phase 2 entry. |
| Branch | `auto-qa` (both repos) |
| Location | `auto-qa/harness/` in both `interface` and `futarchy-api` |
| Runner | `npm run auto-qa:e2e` (separate from `npm run auto-qa:test`) |
| Owner | TBD |
| First-pass deadline | TBD |

## Effort breakdown (rough, per component)

| Component | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anvil fork + block clock + tx replay | S (1 wk) | Foundry already does this |
| Synthetic wallet stub for Playwright | M (2 wk) | Synpress mostly works; futarchy custom auth flows are the gotcha |
| Local Checkpoint indexer in CI | L (3 wk) | Schema migrations + warm-up time make this brittle |
| Cross-layer invariant DSL + assertion library | M (2 wk) | Has to be readable enough to debug failures |
| Scenario library (5-10 historical replays) | L (3 wk) | Each historical proposal needs careful state capture |
| OCR / DOM-equivalent price extraction | M (2 wk) | Brittle without good test IDs in the UI |
| Chaos injection + RPC fault library | S (1 wk) | tc/iptables wrapper |
| CI infra (compose, artifact capture, video on fail) | M (2 wk) | Probably the biggest day-2 cost |
| **Total** | **~3-4 months for one engineer** | |

## Phasing

Each phase is independently useful — we can stop at any phase boundary and
still have value.

| # | Phase | Effort | Stop-here value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Scaffold | 1-2 hrs | `harness/` dirs, deps, README, npm script skeleton, PROGRESS entries |
| 1 | Anvil fork + block clock | ~1 wk | Deterministic time control over a forked Gnosis chain |
| 2 | Chain ↔ api agreement (1 invariant) | ~1 wk | First cross-layer check working end-to-end |
| 3 | Local Checkpoint indexer in-loop | ~3 wks | Indexer reconciles with chain after each block |
| 4 | Synthetic wallet + first scripted swap | ~2 wks | Real on-chain mutation, full chain↔indexer↔api check |
| 5 | Playwright + DOM↔API assertions | ~3 wks | Frontend in the loop; UI consistency catches |
| 6 | Scenario library (replay 1 historical proposal) | ~2 wks | First "real bug shape" replayable |
| 7 | Chaos injection + nightly CI | ~2 wks | Production-shape resilience signal |

```

Single docker-compose starts all four services. Orchestrator owns the clock.

## Cross-layer invariants

| Layer A | vs | Layer B | Invariant |
|---|---|---|---|
| chain | vs | indexer | every Swap event present, same token amounts, same sqrtPrice |
| indexer | vs | api `/candles/graphql` | candle aggregates match raw swaps |
| api `/spot-candles` | vs | api `/candles/graphql` | rate-applied prices reconcile |
| api `/v2/.../chart` | vs | indexer raw | unified-chart shape consistent |
| frontend DOM | vs | api response | every visible price/volume/TVL matches the API call that produced it |
| playwright wallet swap | vs | chain receipt | tx mined, balance delta correct, conditional tokens minted |

## Economic invariants (always-on)

- **Conservation**: ∑(YES + NO conditional tokens) = ∑(sDAI deposited) at every block
- **Monotonicity**: TWAP window endpoints respect contract's `min(now, twapEnd)` clamp
- **Probability**: price ∈ [0, 1] for PREDICTION pools
- **No phantom mints**: `balanceOfBatch` sums match historical + synthetic deposits
- **Rate sanity**: sDAI rate from on-chain `getRate()` ≥ 1 and monotonically increasing

## Bug shapes this catches that nothing else can

- Indexer/chain divergence after a reorg or schema change
- Frontend showing stale numbers when the API is healthy (PR #64 shape from interface)
- Conservation breaks from new merge/split paths
- TWAP window off-by-one at the resolution boundary (PR #54 shape)
- BUY/SELL inversion regressions in `subgraphTradesClient.js`
- Multi-RPC fallback being silently broken
- Wallet-flow regressions in `useFutarchy`
- Cross-protocol price drift between Algebra / CoW / Sushi quoters

## Open decisions (deferred to per-phase work)

- **Foundry vs Hardhat** for the fork — leaning Foundry/anvil (faster, simpler RPC)
- **Local Checkpoint vs subgraph** — Checkpoint matches production but harder to bootstrap
- **Synpress vs custom wallet stub** for Playwright — Synpress is canonical but futarchy's custom flows may need extension
- **Scenario capture format** — JSON snapshot of (block range, tx list, expected end-state) vs full state-dump replay
- **CI execution model** — nightly cron vs manually-triggered workflow vs PR-gated

## Iteration log

### Phase 0 — Scaffold

- **slice 1** — README, harness package.json with stub scripts,
  .gitignore, root `npm run auto-qa:e2e` wired through
  `npm --prefix auto-qa/harness run phase-status`. Verified the stub
  prints the phase status from the repo root. No deps installed yet.

- **slice 2** — `docker-compose.yml` skeleton committed. All real
  services (anvil, indexer, api, interface-dev, orchestrator) are
  block-commented with the eventual launch command + healthcheck +
  volume layout pinned. A `placeholder` (hello-world) service keeps
  `docker compose config` valid for CI dry-runs. Networking pinned to
  a single `harness-net` bridge; volumes go to `.compose-volumes/`
  (gitignored).

- **slice 3** — `scripts/start-fork.mjs` placeholder. Argument parsing
  + help text + structured exit codes documented (0 ready, 1 args, 2
  binary, 3 unreachable, 4 readiness timeout). `--help` works today;
  actual `anvil` subprocess launch is queued for Phase 1.

- **slice 4** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` cross-repo handshake doc. Identical
  copy lives in `interface/auto-qa/harness/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Documents
  the 5-service topology, repo split table, boot sequence, invariant
  catalogue, sibling-clone instructions, and 5 deferred open questions.

- **slice 5** — `docs/ADR-001-foundry-vs-hardhat.md` written by
  background agent. **Decision: Foundry/anvil.** Per-tx replay
  throughput dominates our workload, anvil's `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp`
  + manual `evm_mine` covers our TWAP-window needs without Hardhat's
  `hardhat_mine` advantage, and the single Rust binary cuts CI footprint
  vs a Node + node_modules Hardhat project. Long-run memory creep
  mitigated via snapshot/revert at scenario boundaries.

- **slice 6** — `npm install` ran cleanly in `auto-qa/harness/`,
  generating `package-lock.json` (300 bytes — empty deps tree, but
  reproducible for future additions). Verified no pollution of root
  `package.json` install.

- **slice 7** — `docker compose -f auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml
  config` validates cleanly. Removed the obsolete `version: "3.9"`
  field per Compose v2 deprecation. Output shows the placeholder
  service + harness-net bridge as expected.

- **slice 8** — `CHECKLIST.md` mirrored across both repos. Enumerates
  Phase 0 → Phase 7 readiness gates plus 3 cross-cutting acceptance
  gates (no production code mods, no real mainnet RPC during runs,
  harness deps isolated from root). All Phase 0 mechanical items
  checked; 2 human-gated items remain (ADR human review + full
  sister-link clone verification on a clean machine).

**Phase 0 status: code-complete.** Two human-gated items in
`CHECKLIST.md` remain before declaring Phase 0 done and starting
Phase 1:

  1. Both ADRs reviewed by a human + status changed from "Proposed"
     to "Accepted"
  2. Sister-link verified: a fresh `git clone` of both repos in
     `~/code/futarchy-fi/` runs `docker compose config` cleanly
     (the snippet in `ARCHITECTURE.md` is correct as written, but
     hasn't been exercised on a clean machine yet)

### Phase 1 — Anvil fork + block clock

- **slice 1** — `scripts/detect-anvil.mjs`: discovers anvil/cast/forge
  on PATH, parses `--version`, enforces a `MIN_VERSION = 1.0.0`,
  exposes `detectAnvil()` + `requireAnvil()` (the latter throws with a
  clear `foundryup` install hint). CLI mode prints a 3-line summary or
  `--json` for machine consumption. Confirmed working with locally
  installed Foundry 1.5.0-stable.

- **slice 1** — `scripts/start-fork.mjs` rewritten from scaffold to
  real launcher. Spawns anvil with resolved options, streams output to
  stderr (prefixed `[anvil]`), polls JSON-RPC `eth_blockNumber` every
  250ms until success or 30s timeout, then emits `READY <port>` on
  stdout for orchestrator consumption. SIGINT/SIGTERM forwarded; exit
  code mirrors anvil's. Documented exit-code taxonomy (0/1/2/3/4).

- **slice 1** — `scripts/block-clock.mjs` (new): thin JSON-RPC wrapper
  exposing `mineBlock(rpcUrl, count=1)`, `setNextTimestamp(rpcUrl, ts)`,
  `increaseTime(rpcUrl, delta)`, `snapshot(rpcUrl)`, `revert(rpcUrl, id)`,
  `setBalance(rpcUrl, addr, weiHex)`, `impersonateAccount`,
  `stopImpersonating`, plus `blockNumber`, `chainId`, `getBalance`
  query helpers. Custom `RpcError` class wraps non-2xx + JSON-RPC
  `error` envelopes. CLI mode runs a snapshot/mine/revert smoke
  against an external anvil. AbortController-backed 10s timeout per
  call.

- **slice 1** — `tests/smoke-fork.test.mjs` (new): node:test that
  spawns start-fork as a child process, awaits `READY`, runs
  block-clock through chainId/blockNumber/mine-10/snapshot/mine-5/revert
  round-trip, asserts heights, and SIGTERMs cleanly. **Validated
  end-to-end against `https://rpc.gnosis.gateway.fm` 2026-05-10:
  forked at block 46104021, all assertions pass, total runtime 2.8s.**
  Skips cleanly when anvil isn't on PATH.

- **slice 1** — `auto-qa/harness/package.json` scripts wired:
  `phase-status`, `detect`, `fork`, `smoke`, `test` (node:test on
  `tests/**`). Root `package.json` adds `auto-qa:e2e:detect`,
  `auto-qa:e2e:fork`, `auto-qa:e2e:smoke` shortcuts.

- **slice 2** — `docker-compose.yml` anvil block UNCOMMENTED + simplified.
  Uses published `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest`, command list
  (no shell), exposes `${ANVIL_HOST_PORT:-8545}:8545`, healthcheck via
  `cast block-number` with 5s start_period + 30 retries.
  Phase 0 placeholder service removed. New `tests/smoke-compose.test.mjs`
  drives `up -d` → await healthy → block-clock round-trip → `down -v`,
  with graceful SKIP when docker daemon unreachable. Wired as
  `npm run auto-qa:e2e:smoke:compose`. Live runtime validation needs
  Docker Desktop running; daemon was down during this iteration so
  the test currently skips.

- **slice 3** — `setNextTimestamp` runtime test added to
  `smoke-fork.test.mjs`. Pins next-block timestamp to (now+1h),
  mines, reads back via `eth_getBlockByNumber`, asserts exact
  match. Then mines a follow-up block and confirms timestamp >=
  pinned (anvil increments by 1s). **Validated** — pinned to
  `now+3600`, asserted exact, follow-up `+1s`.

- **slice 4** — `setBalance` runtime test: pin a target address to
  100 ETH (`0x56bc75e2d63100000`), confirm `eth_getBalance` returns
  that exact value. **Validated** against `0xff00ff00ff…` (had no
  prior balance on Gnosis fork — but assertion is on the post-set
  state regardless, since some Gnosis vanity addresses carry dust).

- **slice 4** — `impersonateAccount` runtime test: fund a fictional
  whale, impersonate, send 1 ETH from whale to recipient via
  `eth_sendTransaction` (only possible while impersonating), mine,
  confirm recipient balance. Stops impersonation in `finally`.
  **Validated** — sent 1 ETH between two synthetic addresses.

**Phase 1 status: COMPLETE.** All 6 CHECKLIST items ticked. 4 smoke
tests passing in ~11s total against a real Gnosis fork.

**Smoke summary (last full run, 2026-05-10):**

```
Phase 1 smoke — start-fork + block-clock        ✓ ~3s
Phase 1 slice 3 — setNextTimestamp              ✓ ~2.5s
Phase 1 slice 4 — setBalance                    ✓ ~2.5s
Phase 1 slice 4 — impersonateAccount            ✓ ~3s
Phase 1 slice 2 — compose smoke                  ⊘ skipped (daemon down)
```

**Phase 2 entry criteria (from CHECKLIST):**

- [ ] Local futarchy-api launchable with `RPC_URL` pointed at the
      harness anvil
- [ ] Orchestrator can hit BOTH the api endpoint AND anvil directly
      and compare a single number (e.g. block height)
- [ ] First invariant landed: `chainBlockNumber === api.healthBlock`
